# VSCode - Character Count

The Character Count extension for Visual Studio Code counts and displays the number of characters in a Markdown file in the status bar and updates as you type. This was specifically developed because I needed to use character count vice word count in a piece I was developing. 

The code in this extension was loosely based on Microsoft's [WordCount](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-wordcount) extension.

## Features

Open a Markdown file and the status bar will display the number of characters (including newlines) present in the file. It will be updated as you type.

## Known Issues

(none)
